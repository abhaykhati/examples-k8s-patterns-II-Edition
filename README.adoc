This GitHub project contains the examples from _Kubernetes Patterns - Reusable Elements for Designing Cloud Native Applications, Second Edition_ https://www.amazon.com/_/dp/1098131681?tag=oreilly20-20[book] by https://github.com/bibryam[Bilgin Ibryam] and https://hachyderm.io/@ro14nd[Roland Hu√ü]

IMPORTANT: Most of the examples have been updated for this second edition of the book and examples have been added for the new chapters. However, we are not fully finished yet with updating everything. You can follow the status on the https://github.com/orgs/k8spatterns/projects/2[example roadmap]. We expect to be finished at the end of April 2023. Every pattern that has not yet been updated is listed below with an **[*]**. Thanks for your patience, and we hope you enjoy the book!

NOTE: All the examples that we have updated have been checked on minikube or kind with Kubernetes 1.26. If you run in any issues, please open a https://github.com/k8spatterns/examples/issues[issue] on this repository, we will take as soon as possible. 

Installation instructions for the example prerequisites are summarised in link:INSTALL.adoc[INSTALL].
By default, you need access to a vanilla Kubernetes installation, like Minikube.
However, if add-ons are required, the example description explains this additional requirement.

For feedback, issues, or questions in general, please use the https://github.com/bibryam/k8spatterns/issues[issue tracker] to open cases.
Also, we love contributions like spelling fixes, bug fixes, and improvements;... Please open pull requests; we are happy to review them!

== Patterns

All examples are categorised according to the Book's patterns category.
Each example is contained in a different directory per pattern and is self-contained. footnote:[Examples marked with an "*" are still in progress to be updated. We expect to be finished until the end of April 2023]

=== Foundational Patterns

link:foundational/PredictableDemands/README.adoc[Predictable Demands]::
  Our sample random generator deals with hard requirements on ConfigMap and PersistentVolumeClaims and resource limits.
link:foundational/DeclarativeDeployment/README.adoc[Declarative Deployment]::
  Rolling and fixed update of the random generator Deployment from version 1.0 to 2.0.
link:foundational/HealthProbe/README.adoc[Health Probe]::
  Liveness, Readiness and Startup probes for the random generator and an example how to readiness gates.
link:foundational/ManagedLifecycle/README.adoc[Managed Lifecycle]::
  `postStart` and `preStop` hooks are demonstrated with the random generator application. **[*]**
link:foundational/AutomatedPlacement/README.adoc[Automated Placement]::
  These examples demonstrate a node selector, pod and node affinity, taint, and tolerations. **[*]**

=== Behavioral Patterns

link:behavioral/BatchJob/README.adoc[Batch Job]::
  Generate thousands of random numbers into a file with a batch job
link:behavioral/PeriodicJob/README.adoc[Periodic Job]::
  Reuses the link: behavioral/BatchJob/README.adoc[Batch Job] example, but runs it periodically at a configured schedule
link:behavioral/DaemonService/README.adoc[Daemon Service]::
  Sample maintenance script for maintenance jobs on every node of a cluster
link:behavioral/SingletonService/README.adoc[Singleton Service]::
  Example of a PodDisruptionBudget for controlling voluntary disruptions
link:behavioral/StatelessService/README.adoc[Stateless Service]::
  Example for a stateless service deployed with a ReplicaSet 
link:behavioral/StatefulService/README.adoc[Stateful Service]::
  StatefulSet example for our random-generator
link:behavioral/ServiceDiscovery/README.adoc[Service Discovery]::
  Various ways how to access our random-generator REST service
link:behavioral/SelfAwareness/README.adoc[Self Awareness]::
  Using the Downward API for setting environment variables and mounting resource fields as files with the random-generator service.

=== Structural Patterns

link:structural/InitContainer/README.adoc[Init Container]::
  Initialize an HTTP server's HTML source from a remote git repository **[*]**
link:structural/Sidecar/README.adoc[Sidecar]::
  Git polling example for a sidecar **[*]**
link:structural/Adapter/README.adoc[Adapter]::
  Adapter for exporting timing information from the sample random-generator application in a Prometheus format **[*]**
link:structural/Ambassador/README.adoc[Ambassador]::
  Ambassador for moving on the log of the random-generator **[*]**

=== Configuration Patterns

link:configuration/EnvVarConfiguration/README.adoc[EnvVar Configuration]::
  A simple example of how to use environment variables literally and from ConfigMaps and Secrets for our random-generator service. **[*]**
link:configuration/ConfigurationResource/README.adoc[Configuration Resource]::
  Example of how to configure the random-generator Spring Boot application with a ConfigMap **[*]**
link:configuration/ImmutableConfiguration/README.adoc[Immutable Configuration]:: **[*]**
  Several examples show how to use immutable configuration containers for application configuration. This directory includes examples of the simple Docker case and Kubernetes.
link:configuration/ConfigurationTemplate/README.adoc[Configuration Template]::
  This example shows how to use a template configuration `standalone.xml`, which is processed with a template processed and filled with data from ConfigMap before a Wildfly server is started. **[*]**

=== Security Patterns

link:security/ProcessContainment/README.adoc[Process Containment]::
Example of how you can restrict the privileges of containers when running in Kubernetes.
link:security/NetworkSegmentation/README.adoc[Network Segmentation]::
This example shows you how you can restrict network access to Pods via Network Policies and how to control HTTP traffic with Istio's Authentication Policies.
link:security/SecureConfiguration/README.adoc[Secure Configuration]::
Examples show various techniques for storing configuration data securely in a Kubernetes Cluster. **[*]**
link:security/AccessControl/README.adoc[Access Control]::
Example for Kubernetes' RBAC access control subsystem for controlling the access to the Kubernetes API server. **[*]**

=== Advanced Patterns

link:advanced/Controller/README.adoc[Controller]::
  A simple, pure shell-based controller watches ConfigMap resources for changes and restarts Pods using a label selector provided as an annotation. An additional link:advanced/Controller/expose-controller/README.adoc[example controller] exposes an Ingress route when it detects an `exposeService` label attached to the service. **[*]**
link:advanced/Operator/README.adoc[Operator]::
  Operator based on the ConfigMap watch. **[*]** link:advanced/Controller/README.adoc[controller] and introduces a CRD ConfigWatcher, which connects a ConfigMap with a set of Pods to restart in case of a config change. **[*]**
link:advanced/ElasticScale/README.adoc[Elastic Scale]::
  Horizontal and vertical scaling examples with the random-generator service **[*]**
link:advanced/ImageBuilder/README.adoc[Image Builder]::
  These examples demonstrate the setup of a link:advanced/ImageBuilder/openshift/README.adoc[chained build] on OpenShift and use link:advanced/ImageBuilder/knative/README.adoc[Knative build] for doing builds within the cluster. **[*]**
